# Malware-Detection-Model
## Project Description

This project aims to demonstrate the process of training and evaluating various machine learning models on a dataset. It includes steps for data preprocessing, feature selection, dataset splitting, feature scaling, and training different classifiers. The classifiers used in this project include K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) and Random Forest. Each classifier is evaluated using confusion matrix and accuracy score to measure its performance.

The workflow of this project involves the following steps:

1. **Data Import and Preprocessing:**
    - Importing the dataset and necessary libraries.
    - Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and other preprocessing steps.

2. **Feature Selection:**
    - Using a tree-based feature selection method to identify the most important features in the dataset.

3. **Data Splitting:**
    - Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the models.

4. **Feature Scaling:**
    - Scaling the features to ensure that they are on the same scale, which is essential for many machine learning algorithms.

5. **Model Training and Evaluation:**
    - Training multiple classifiers (K-NN, Random Forest, and XGBoost) on the training set.
    - Predicting the outcomes on the test set.
    - Evaluating the models using confusion matrices to compare their performance.

By following this workflow, the project provides a comprehensive guide to building and evaluating machine learning models, demonstrating best practices in feature selection, model training, and performance evaluation.
